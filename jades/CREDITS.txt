JADES Simulation Library
Copyright (c) 2012 Antonio Cuomo

I am deeply indebted to my Ph.D. supervisor, prof. Umberto Villano, 
and to prof. Massimiliano Rak, for their help and guidance while I was chasing 
dragons (or developing this library, which is the same). 

DISCLAIMER: The design of the simulation library API is inspired to the popular CSIM
for Java simulation package, by Mesquite Software. 
In the original JADES version, the API are very similar, even if the JADES API is 
quite smaller (incomplete, if you want) and the implementation principles are radically
different.
Despite the similarity, I have never accessed CSIM for Java source code 
neither analyzed/used/disassembled its binary code. My only source of information 
about CSIM was the user manual publicly made available by Mesquite Software. 
It is clear what is provided here:
CSIM for Java is a proven, industrial strength software with over 20 year of experience in
its design and implementation, while JADES is a project I developed during my formation years
at university whose aims are:
1) To experiment with Java technology, trying to support a high number of concurrent simulation 
processes (something commonly not accomplished by Java-based process-oriented 
simulation libraries). 
2) To provide to the scientific community a free tool to develop Java-based simulations.
3) To provide to interested people a base source code to use, alter and enhance in any way
they prefer (in accordance with the provided license).
