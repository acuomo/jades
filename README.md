JADES 
=====

JADES is a Java library supporting discrete-event simulations based on the process interaction world view. 

Using JADES, the modeler can
* Describe the simulation model in terms of simulation processes
* Evaluate the simulation model using the provided simulation engine


## Example
The following code shows a simple example of a discrete-event simulation model using JADES


## Testing the example

## History and motivation
JADES was developed by Antonio Cuomo during his Ph.D. at [University of Sannio](http://www.unisannio.it), under the supervision of Prof. Umberto Villano.
The initial aim of the library was to provide a support tool for performance evaluation of distributed
applications. Nevertheless, the library has been designed from the beginning as a domain-agnostic layer supporting 
the specification of many different kinds of discrete-event simulation models in Java.
